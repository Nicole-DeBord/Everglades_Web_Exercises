	<h1>Awkward 'About Me' Blurb, Engage!</h1>

	<p>
		Hi there. My name is Nicole. I <em>really</em> don't like writing about myself, but as I am trying to entertain the demands of my coding overlords, I'll tell you a little bit about myself. Good reader, you are, of course, free to form your own opinions.
		<br>
		Oh, hey!
		<br>
		Coding overlords approved my previously planned magical cat story.
		<br>
		You're just <strong>dying</strong> to hear my magical cat story, right? 
		<br>
		Okay, here it goes!

	<h2>Magical Cat Story, Engage!</h2>
	<p>
		Once upon a time, there was a magical princess kitty called Genga Bean Fluff Whiskers Magical Redundancy Princess Kitty Who Is Also Very Magical; of course, this name was terribly cumbersome, so most kittes simply called her Genga. Genga ruled over a happy magical kingdom, and her only official decree was: <blockquote>"Sleep a lot, preferably while bathing in sunshine."</blockquote> You see, those who say cats are lazy are clearly ignorant of their superior multitasking abilities.
